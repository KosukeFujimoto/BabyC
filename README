- BabyC Compiler Specification -
This file shows specification of BabyC compiler.

BabyC compiler consists following files.

- makefile
- driver.c
- lexer.lex
- parser.y
- openhash.h
- openhash.c
- ast.h
- ast.c



1. how to use

First of all, to generate execution file "bcc", you have to type command "make".

To run execution file "bcc", type ./bcc foo.bc

This program creates foo.iloc

2. Included Files

driver.c has main function that program takes command line arguments.

lexer.lex is given file. I did not change anything.

parser.y is grammer file. 

openhash.c openhash.h define hash table and it holds variables with
- identifier
- value
- offset
- register number

identifier is 20 characters long. If your vairable name is longer than that, the program outputs error.

ast.c ast.h define AST and ILOC function
